- Improve the website by taking suggestions from https://pagespeed.web.dev/ and https://www.webpagetest.org/

## Issues to fix:
- Remove the hero image from the background of the webpage
- Hero image changes size when scrolling down on mobile devices- could be because of h-screen
- Vertical line in the experience section
- Project cards overflow into each other during scroll animation
- Project hover cursor

## Optional:
- Refactor button component so that it can be used in all button instances in the project
- Add change in shadow effect of ProjectCards on hover
